# Ordering Kiosk

## Day 1
* General folder set up
* Homepage Layout
* Created side scroll component


## Day 2
* Added Icons
* Fixed Sidescrollarea component
* Created banner using bing image generator


## Day 3 
* Added images for the menu
* Added data for the menu


## Day 4 
* Continued adding menu images and data
* Made a Product card to successfully fetch data with use of URL
* Possible note, try to use data.



### Project Goal
* Make singular interactable page that where you can access the data (for learning purposes)
* Additional pages would be cart and success page in order to proper practice CSS and also general UI creation 






### Side notes
* When using fetch and relative URL it would default to using localhost 3000 instead of finding the path relative to file
* (e.g in Main.js using "fetch ('../../Assets/all_data')"  it would fetch from "http://localhost:3000/Assets/all_data.js")
* place the data in a url that can be easily accessed
